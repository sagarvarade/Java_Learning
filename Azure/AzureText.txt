Azure : Basic : AZ-900


Cloud Models :
1. SAAS  : Software as a service
2. PAAS  : Platforam as a service  
3. IAAS   : Infra as a service 

Cloud Computing : 

Private cloud , public cloud , Hybrid cloud

Public cloud : Captila free scaling, quick app porvisioning, Pay as you go
Private Cloud : hardware cost, sovereign control
Hybrid cloud : Versatile scalability, strategic application placement , 

Capitval Vs operational Cost 
Opex : operational cost , cost incurred for goods and services on an ongoing basis, with expensed aligned to usage, Invoicing for these expenditure is immediate, Fast paced market

CapEx : capital Expenditure , Initial investment in physical assets, The value of capital expensed diminishes over time through depriciation, Long term investment

Consumption based model :
Pay As you go billing :
1. Flexible resource model
2. Pay as you use
3. no resource locking

Cloud benefits :
1. High availability  : Load balancing, Redundancy, 
2. Scalability   :  Efficient scaling, Scale based on demand ,Resource optimization, Horizontal vs Vertical scaling ,  Cost-effective growth, Handling demand spikes
3. Predictabilty :  Budgeting challenges, cost spikes risk, unpredictable performnace impact, resource allocation issues
4. Governance : Governance policy consistnacy, Cloud environment compliancem, Data protection assurance , Operational integrity maintenance 
Define -> enforce -> Monitor, Governance at scale
5. Elasticity : Unpredictable traffic bursts, Immediate resource allocation,Automatic scaling response, Cost-efficient resource usage
6. Relibility : Continius accesssibility, Data protection priority,fast incident recovery
7. Security  : Security threats, Data breach risks, unauthorized access concern
Network securiity, Data encryption, Indentity management, Thread detection
8. Managebility : Centralized monitorin, Automated tuning , Resource optimization
